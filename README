This little project implements a version of fBm using Simplex Noise to
manipulate terrain in Unity3D. The noise function is applied several times to a
terrain component to manipulate it. By setting the octaves, amplitude and
frequency you can get different results from rocky mountains to gentle hills.

To use the sources in your own unity project copy both scripts into your asset
folder of the project. Create a new scene and add a terrain object to it.
Add the CreateSimplexNoise.cs script to the terrain object.
If you run the scene a button will appear. Clicking the button starts the fBm
procedure. Because the heightmap of the terrain is manipulated, the change of
the terrain is permanent – even if you stop the execution of the scene.

The preset parameters are good for rocky mountains. 
Octave should not exceed 28. Blend should be a value between 0 and 1 -
see the source code for detailed information.

To get a better understanding how different octaves, amplitudes and frequencies
affects the resulting heightmap I found this site helpful (after blinding out
the paper background):

The implementation of the Simplex Noise is based on the java implementation
by Stefan Gustavson presented in his article "Simplex noise demystified".
